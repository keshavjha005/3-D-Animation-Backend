React 3d app example
An example react app using create-react-app and @react-three-fiber.

This repo is a react-based 3D experience for the browser using the basic react-three-fiber example as a starting point. The idea is to take a submarine model from Blender and render it using three.js and allow the user to interact with it in some way. I started with a simple interface that allows changing the submarine color and texture and then added the ability to spin the propeller when pressing the arrow up key. See the demo to play around with it in its current state.
